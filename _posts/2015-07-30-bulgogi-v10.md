Had the house all to myself for a night, so decided to make bulgogi with Amy. We followed [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/beef-bulgogi/).

###Ingredients:
- Flank Steak, thinly sliced

####Marinade
- Soy Sauce
- White Sugar
- Green Onions, chopped
- Garlic, minced
- Sesame Seeds
- Sesame Oil
- Black Pepper, ground

We went to [99 Ranch](99ranch.com), a Chinese supermarket, to get most of the ingredients, including the meat. We couldn't find pre-sliced flank steak, so we asked the butcher there to slice it for us. Unfortunately, for safety, the employees there are not supposed to slice meat too thin, and he instead cut it into small chunks, which we had to further slice ourselves.

After preparing the marinade, pour it over the meat and let it sit for an hour. Normally we should have done so for longer, but the decision to make this was relatively impromptu, so we didn't have the luxury of letting it marinate longer.

Preheat a lightly oiled grill to high heat, put the meat on for a couple minutes on each side.

Amy also makes a solid kimchi fried rice.

###Ingredients:
- Kimchi
- White Rice
- [Gochujang](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gochujang)
- Garlic, minced
- Sesame Seeds
- Sesame Oil
- Black Pepper, ground

Mix white rice and kimchi in a pan, add garlic, sesame seeds and oil, and black pepper, then gochujang to taste.

All in all, a pretty good meal.

###TODO:
- Get correctly sliced & sized meat.
- Use less sugar for marinade.
- Marinate meat for longer.
