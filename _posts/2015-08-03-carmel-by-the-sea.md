Had the pleasure of traveling to Carmel-by-the-Sea with a few friends over the weekend.

### Day 1

Drove up from Saratoga to Union City to pick everyone up, and then all the way back down to Monterey. I don't find long drives very fun.

It took until around 10 p.m. for us to get settled in, and then we could finally start on dinner. Couldn't find any black pepper, so we had steaks rubbed with just salt, some quick garlic bread, and boiled potatoes.

Found this guy sitting around.

Brought a bunch of board games, but just ended up playing quite a few rounds of [Sushi Go](http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&page=game&show=291). It's quick and addicting, just the way I like my games. A bunch of sushi boats go around the circle, and you try to construct the best meal possible.

Late night vacation cravings.

### Day 2

Cloudy morning snaps.

We used Airbnb to find our place, and got pretty lucky. The house was recently renovated (or built), so basically everything, from the pots and pans to the towels, was new. The only problem was the kitchen wasn't as stocked as we'd liked (no black pepper or cooking oils).

Headed to [Point Lobos State Natural Reserve](http://www.pointlobos.org/) for the day.

An island of seals.

A nice throwback of PB&J for lunch.

This was around the time Tim got bitten by a tick. It was a bit of a scare, but it turns out there's no real danger if the tick is removed fast enough. Good things his reactions are quick.

Low tide.

![][August-3-15]

After a quick respite from our hike (and quite the parking ordeal), we settled down in Carmel Beach to watch the sun set.

Warming hot dogs over coals in the sand is difficult and only sometimes rewarding.

A chill night and trip.
