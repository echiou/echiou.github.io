      <h1>A Bit More Info</h1>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm a Firmware Engineer at <a href="http://mindtribe.com" target="_blank">Mindtribe</a>, where I build cutting-edge hardware products with our clients in multidisciplinary teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, I've worked on products in various stages of their life cycles: from tuning LEDs with designers during beta tests, to validating assumptions by quickly bringing up BLE prototypes and an Android app, to guiding firmware efforts on a project-level.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, focusing largely on Human-Computer Interaction. I co-authored a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3173574.3173723" target="_blank">paper about Digital Fabrication</a> while working under <a href="http://www.paulos.net/" target="_blank">Eric Paulos</a> and <a href="https://rutian.github.io/" target="_blank">Kevin Tian</a> which won an Honorable Mention Award at CHI '18.
