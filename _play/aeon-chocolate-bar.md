For Valentine's Day, I had my apartmentmate make a bespoke bar of chocolate for me from scratch. Something he had been wanting to try was mixing coffee into his chocolate, so I thought it would be an interesting & symbolic experiment.

Because I wasn't going to be that involved in the actual chocolate making process, I put my efforts into the packaging, a laser-cut wooden box - this is the lid.

On the inside of the lid, the origins of the cacao, and the coffee beans. The cacao is a Vietnamese Single Origin from [Chocolate Alchemy](http://chocolatealchemy.com/), which Eric had been making his way through, so we decided to contrast its natural tart & fruitiness with darker roasted, nutty Indonesian coffee beans from Flores Island, courtesy of [Happy Mug Coffee](http://www.happymugcoffee.com/). It was also neat that both were sourced from Southeast Asia.

The outside wrapping paper was from [Paper Source](http://www.papersource.com/). The name Aeon came from my roommate, who suggested a name with the grapheme Æ in it, and I figured a something that literally meant "an indefinite and very long period of time" was good for a Valentine's Day gift. Unfortunately, Æ renders pretty strangely in most fonts, so I just seperated them back out in the final product.

Only 2% of the final composition of the bar was coffee, but the taste does come out - a natural sourness reveals itself and complements the chocolate quite well, but the coffee's more "traditional" coffee taste is present and gives the bar a pretty unique taste.
