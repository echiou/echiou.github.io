A small project I did to practice my web design and to think about something a bit out of the ordinary for me.

##Context

I first had this idea while watching some friends paint their nails. I noticed that most of their nail polish bottles weren't even half used, and inquired how often they actually finished and disposed of their polish. The overall consensus was that such a thing only happened to top coat, clear nail polish used to seal and protect the layers below. However, they would continue to buy new bottles because they liked the colors or wanted certain seasonal polishes to match modern fashion, which resulted in an excess of nail polish, a "collection" which becomes more and more difficult to use up over time.

When I returned to school, I asked [a friend](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anneslin) if I could borrow her nail polish collection, looking at each bottle and how much polish each contained. Looking at the colors that had been used more, I reasoned that the less popular colors were purchased on a whim or because they were in style then, but had since gone out of fashion, leaving over 75% of it unused. This is a waste of the consumers' money, the plastic and glass used in the bottle, and the nail polish itself, all in the name of the cosmetic companies' profit.

With my newfound knowledge about the cosmetic industry, I began thinking of various solutions, settling on a fairly simple one - a "sampler" of sorts, with small amounts of nail poish packaged together in seasonal or trendy color combinations. I then set off to make a website for it, with some basic HTML and CSS and minimal javascript, designing the images in Adobe Illustrator. The final site can be found [here](http://echiou.com/reimagining-nail-polish).

##Final Thoughts

I really enjoyed working on this because I felt that working in a space as an outsider, with no assumptions or previous knowledge, allowed me to try some more out-of-the-box things. Now that I have a bit of experience in rapid prototyping, I want to revisit this project and see if I can do something more with it, or at the very least 3D print a prototype to play with. Perhaps more to come!
