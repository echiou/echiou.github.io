This past summer, I had privilege of working as a firmware engineering intern at [Mindtribe](http://mindtribe.com), an engineering & product development consultancy based in San Francisco. I was lucky enough to have been placed on a client project during my time there, however, there is a limit on how much I can share about my work because of confidentiality contracts.

In my time there, I worked on two main things: a consumer electronics device, and an internal Internet of Things project. Both of those let me learn a lot of essential product development skills, not only writing production code for the client, but also conducting battery rundown tests to evaluate our battery IC, bringing up an ESP8266 and prototyping a water usage recording device for quick concept validation, and writing tests to ensure that all our components were interacting together as expected.
