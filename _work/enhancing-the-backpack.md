Part of my application to [Berkeley Innovation](http://innovation.berkeley.edu), Enhancing the Backpack was one of the first times I went through the entire design process, from user research to prototyping & testing. [This is what I submitted.](/other/Enhancing-The-Backpack.pdf)

When I first started the assignment, I knew I wanted to do something with bags or backpacks, but wasn't exactly sure what kind of improvements could be made. For some preliminary user research, I went to [Asha Tea House](http://www.ashateahouse.com) in downtown Berkeley to see how people interacted with their bags. One of the common things I witnessed was people having to place their bags on the table, ground, or their laps before anything could be taken out. Noting this, I decided to tackle that problem.

##Design Approach

###Existing Products

Using this information, I examined existing solutions and what worked (and what didn't) about them. Tote bags, for example, can be opened easily and were spacious, but are neither ergonomic to carry nor easily organized. Single-strap backpacks and messenger bags, while a little better, still do not provide the load management of a double-strap. Side pockets on backpacks, originally designed for water bottles, are sometimes used to hold people's keys and phones for easy access, but are also easily stolen from and make for awkward arm positions when reaching back.

###A Possible Solution

![][etb-7]

After some deliberation, I concluded that it was because bags had to be opened from the top that they had to be taken off or put down before they could be looked and rifled though. The solution I came up to was a seperate "easy-access" compartment for commonly used things. This would save time in taking things out when quick access is needed or when sitting down.

This compartment would be designed to fit laptops, as well as notebooks or textbooks (but not too many, as to discourage rifling through things), but also be bottom-opening for access while standing or before sitting. Some sort of double-safe closure, for example with a magnetic flap as well as a buckle, would be needed to prevent things from falling out or being stolen. Finally, a side compartment would allow quick access for smaller things, like phones or wallets.

##Prototyping & Testing

![][etb-4]

In order to see if my solution was viable, I made a quick prototype by safety pinning a laptop sleeve so the mouth was facing downwards. Letting the backpack hang on one shoulder while taking things out wasn't as intuitive as I thought it would be. It took some time getting used to, despite being a bit more efficient.

The progression when sitting down is smoother than with a backpack. After the initial adjusting period, taking the backpack off and taking the laptop & books out can be done in one smooth motion rather than in two, as with before (putting the backpack down, then taking the laptop and books out).

##Final Thoughts

All in all, the prototype worked as intended. It made accessing the things in the back compartment easier, and fit the various objects that it would be designed for. Several of the observed problems included comfort, which could be fixed with more ergonomic padding, side preference, which could affect usage of side compartments, and the “learning curve” associated with this new way of opening backpacks.
