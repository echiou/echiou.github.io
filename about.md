## Hello there, my name is Ethan.

I am currently a student at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/), studying [Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/). More specifically, I enjoy the field of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction).
