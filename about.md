## Hello there. I'm Ethan.

I am currently a student at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/), studying [Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/). More specifically, I enjoy the field of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction), studying and designing both physical and digital interfaces to be used by people.

This website is meant to be a junction between my [casual interests](/blog) and my [technical work](/work), helping me more easily bridge the two.

More about my coursework and professional experience can be found on my [résumé](/other/resume.pdf).

Want to talk? [Hit me up.](/contact)
