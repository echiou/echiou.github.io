My family decided to swing by Australia on the way to Taiwan this Winter, so my Christmas was spent sweating in Brisbane. Here are some highlights.

### Day 1

![][December-27-1]

Christmas lunch (which is a pretty serious thing here) at [Jellyfish](http://www.jellyfishrestaurant.com.au).

![][December-27-2]

A seafood sampler plate, with sashimi, fish wings, [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thenus) , prawns, and oysters.

![][December-27-3]

Finished off with some chocolage meringue over a cake of sorts, topped with raspberry sorbet.

![][December-27-4]

Walked around to explore the parks & streets of the city. It was a bit surreal to see Christmas decorations outside while I was wearing a t-shirt.

![][December-27-5]

Wasn't given a tour, so I can't say I know much about [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V).

![][December-27-6]

Unintentionally festive, still cute. I looked, but couldn't find a train.

![][December-27-7]

Watched the sunset from [Mt. Coot-Tha](http://www.brisbanelookout.com) and caught the moon rising simultaneously.

### Day 2

![][December-27-8]

Started [Boxing Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day) off with [Gramercy Coffee](http://www.gramercycoffee.com.au), or rather its smaller caf√© in a nearby shopping center. They serve not only coffee, but also various (relatively high priced) breakfast foods. Also of note was that there was full table service here - somebody would come by and take your coffee order after you sat down.

![][December-27-9]

I normally drink my coffee black, but their housemade almond milk is supposed to be good, so I added some of that. It was a pretty solid cup of coffee, although I won't profess to being the best at coffee tasting.

![][December-27-10]

A breakfast burger, with egg and prosciutto. Their smashed avocado, served on sourdough bread, in the back.

![][December-27-11]

The hippest of granolas.

![][December-27-12]

Afterwards, rushed over to the docks to catch a boat for a river cruise...

![][December-27-15]

... and headed to the [Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary](http://www.koala.net).

![][December-27-13]

These guys can sleep for up to 20 hours a day, so it was a wonder that they were awake at all for us to hold & take pictures with. They go on rotations, so they're not too overwhelmed by guests. Queensland is the only state in Australia in which people can still pat and hold them.

If you wake him he will choke you out with his huge biceps.

![][December-27-18]

When we had had our share of animals, we headed back to get some dinner, and then went to South Bank for dessert at [Cowch](http://www.cowch.com.au). They make desserts, cocktails, and dessert cocktails.

![][December-27-17]

Some [familiar looking](http://www.pop-bar.com) popsicles.

![][December-27-19]

![][December-27-20]

Walking around a bit more, we found a beach in the middle of the city!

![][December-27-16]

Donuts are apparently a big thing here.

### Day 3

![][December-27-24]

More donuts, this time at [Surfer's Paradise](http://www.surfersparadise.com).

![][December-27-23]

Unsure of how much of what's wrong with this sign is on purpose.

![][December-27-22]

![][December-27-21]

![][December-27-25]

Some black forest pancakes from [Pancakes in Paradise](http://www.http://pancakesinsurfersparadise.com.au).

![][December-27-26]

After an extremely unhealthy afternoon, went to Mt. Tambourine to see glow worms (no pictures allowed!) and the Rainforest Walk.

![][December-27-28]

Chilling in the canopy.

Until next time!
