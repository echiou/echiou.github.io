A pretty free week with some fun moments, but its fair share of what I can only describe as claustrophobia. The grind begins next week.

![][Doggo]

Friendly Icelandic doggo from our campsite. Contrary to what my Instagram suggested, he did not do a bork.

![][Town]

A good portion of the trip was spent standing on the side of the road after walking around and admiring the scenery, even while just in town. This is Borgarnes.

![][Fisheye]

Some fisheye goodness for everyone at Barnafossar.

![][Lava Waterfall]

Hraunfossar, or Lava Falls.

![][Hot Springs]

Deildartunguhver thermal spring, with boiling-hot water, being piped somewhere. A cool 99% of Iceland's energy is from renewable resources, and something that helps a lot is the hot water they can pull from the ground and use. Unfortunately, it also smells like rotten eggs.
