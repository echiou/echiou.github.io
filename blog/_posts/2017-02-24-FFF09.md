Today was my birthday, but I had a pretty mediocre day - I left my charger in the lab and broke my Hario V60 against the countertop. But we are the ones who decide how our days end, so I suited up, ran back to the lab, followed someone into the building, grabbed my charger, headed home, and ordered the ingredients for a DIY faux-[*kintsugi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi).
