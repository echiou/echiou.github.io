A friend took me around the [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) HQ at [888 Brannan](http://888brannan.com/) yesterday. It's one of the coolest, if not the coolest workspaces I've ever toured.

As soon as you walk into space, you're greeted by a beautiful, sun-lit lobby for people to meet, grab snacks, or work.

A glass elevator takes you up the 5 floors (of which Airbnb owns the third, fourth, fifth, and part of the first). [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) owns the second.

First up was the history and branding room.

Requisite jokes aside, I really can support the meaning behind the [BÃ©lo](http://blog.airbnb.com/belong-anywhere/). You have to remember that the founders are [RISD](http://www.risd.edu/) graduates and know what they're doing when it comes to branding. With a little luck, in a few years, this will be seen as an iconic logo.

Small scale models of actual Airbnb listings. This is a water tower in London which went for $210 a night.

![][August-7-2]

Branding nerd stuff.

![][August-7-5]

Culture wall - various aspects of Airbnb's office culture are displayed here, from the $40,000 orange juice machine to coffee chats.

![][August-7-3]

The Airbnb war room. Probably the most no-nonsense room in the entirety of of the building. Serious meetings happen here.

![][August-7-6]

Various other meeting rooms, workspaces, and cafeteria areas are designed after listings that Airbnb has had, named after the cities in which they are located.

The little sign to the top right of the coffee grinder tells you who to ping if you want a tutorial on operating the various coffee machines.

![][August-7-8]

[Brian Cheskey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Chesky)'s favorite listing, a small round hut with a bed in the upper attic area.

![][August-7-7]

Having incurred sizable credit card debt when starting AirBed&Breakfast (which was initially named that because they literally rented out an airbed to people, giving them Pop-Tarts for breakfast in the morning), the founders designed and sold [Cap'n McCain's](https://www.airbnb.com/capnmccains) and [Obama O's](https://www.airbnb.com/obamaos) during the 2008 elections. They had to hand cut, fold, and construct the boxes themselves, but managed to sell a thousand of them at $40 a pop, digging themselves out of debt. They went on to show [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_%28computer_programmer%29) the cereal after a supposedly botched [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) interview to prove their tenacity, and were subsequently accepted into the program. The rest is history, and this integral part of Airbnb's past is proudly displayed around the office.

The office is dog friendly! Extra points in my book.

![][August-7-10]

The "Grassy Knoll", a park-themed common area, complete with hammocks, lawn chairs, and fake grass.

![][August-7-11]

Normally each of the small workspace rooms just has a monitor, desk, and chair, but renovations (like this one) are encouraged. An intern designed this room for "Hackairthon", the internal hackathon, with a budget of $1200 a room. I also saw ice cave, Hello Kitty birthday, and Japanese ramen shop themed rooms.

![][August-7-12]

Design lab. My type of space.

![][August-7-14]

Various quirks abound in the office, like this ice cream cart next to people's desks. I also didn't notice the pineapple on screen in the background until later.

![][August-7-15]

The main cafeteria is (appropriately) named AteAteAte. The food was good and the orange juice (as mentioned above) fresh.

![][August-7-16]

A beautiful workspace. Definetely would not mind working here in the future, but I suppose that's a problem for another day.
