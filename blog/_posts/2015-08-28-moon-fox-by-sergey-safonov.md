Managed to get my hands on this toy from [Sergey Safonov](http://sergeysafonov.com/). It's a variation on his popular Moon Fox/Moon Wanderers toy series, which I actually list as inspiration in my [about](/about) page, so you can probably guess that I was pretty excited by this purchase.

This is actually a kit to build your own Moon Fox and boat, Ã  la [Gunpla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_model). It was produced by [Crazylabel](http://crazylabel.com/), which actually also made a corresponding [iPhone app](http://crazylabel.com/papermoonapp/) to go with it, telling the Moon Fox's story. Unfortunately, Crazylabel is now actually [closed for business](http://blog.crazylabel.com/post/99042993124/announcement), but they're still selling the kits for $20 (with $10 shipping to the US). I picked mine up from Amazon for quite a bit cheaper.

The packaging looks and feels really nice, with a matte finish on the cardboard. You can see the inspiration from Gundam models, from the plastic shrink-wrap around it, to the cardboard trays used as a box (with the inner one undecorated).

I really enjoy the small, well-designed and thought-out graphics on the packaging, such as the Chinese lettering on the top and this Moon Wanderers logo.

The kit also came in a translucent "Moonlight", which is a nice aesthetic, but I got the "Cloudwhite" for a cleaner look.

Inside the box, we have what we really want: the Moon Fox parts in a runner, simple build instructions, some moon and star stickers, and a short illustrated story about the Moon Fox itself (which adds a bit more context to the stickers).

Unfortunately, I didn't have a pair of [diagonal/side cutters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_pliers) as is standard in the Gunpla community, so I had to settle for some pliers with wire cutters on them. Even though my tools were non-optimal, the sprue itself was also not the best, a bit thick to cut cleanly.

All the parts laid out.

Some filing required to make everything fit (which I'm assuming is partially my fault for cutting too far from the parts).

Sailing in an ocean of white.

Still need some sanding and touch-up, but that's for another day.

Really liked the Gundam-esque idea and packaging, and I'm happy for this less-expensive version of the (normally $70) resin figure. The MSRP (and shipping from Hong Kong) could get a bit expensive, but I think it's worth it for a beautiful and fun-to-build piece like this, especially if you're able to find it for a bit cheaper like I was.

Slowly growing.
