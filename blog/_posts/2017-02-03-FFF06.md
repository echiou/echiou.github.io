Finished up Korea, and moving on to Taiwan now!

Spent the first day just taking Instax pictures of Amy... film well spent.

Met up with some friends I made in Singapore and rode around the Pingxi Line.

The store's general manager eyeing us warily.

Got a free sky lantern from 阿嬤的店 from probably the nicest shopkeeper I've ever met.

![][Railroad]

The railroad at 十分. We released another lantern here for funsies, but didn't make it out to 平溪 (the de facto place to do so).
