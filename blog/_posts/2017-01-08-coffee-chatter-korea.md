Coffee Chatter will be a collection of random thoughts I have about coffee or cafes. I'll use it to document my coffee adventures, from home brewing to exploring cafes and roasteries.

### Cafe Culture in Korea

I recently had the pleasure of visiting Seoul, Korea as the final trip of my semester abroad. While I knew the specialty coffee scene was alive and well there, I did not know why it developed the way it did, even after visiting several cafes. However, after meeting up with a friend and talking about the culture & youth of Korea, I began to have a better idea.

**DISCLAIMER:** These views are only my hypotheses and are thoughts I had after viewing this country & culture from what amounts to a keyhole. The [actual history](http://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2015/11/korean-coffee-culture-101-a-timeline/) of [coffee in Korea](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Coffee_in_Korea) is quite well documented, I just thought this particular aspect was interesting.

In my head, several things converge to bring about the types of cafes I saw in Korea:

  - Children tend to live with their parents before marriage. (Apology #1 if this claim is incorrect or offensive)
  - Korean culture has heavy emphasis on image. (And... apology #2)
  - There is somewhat of a dating culture.

Naturally, this doesn't include the use of cafes for non-dating purposes, but the gist is the same: people want to meet up for dates or meetings, but this is more difficult at homes where others live and can be disturbed. An external location (e.g. a cafe) is picked, preferably one which will not reflect poorly on all parties involved. Therefore, cafes are not only expected serve good coffee, but also look good and be viable meeting spots. And thus, we have specialty coffee being served in aesthetically pleasing spaces.

As such, the first thing I noticed when walking into cafes was the how they looked. Cafes in Seoul clearly place a lot of weight on how they look and feel, of course as one should, but this was almost to a obsessive extent - one looked so sterile that it seemed to have been designed for Instagram. Another (pictures below) had, in my opinion, the most meticulous branding I've seen for a cafe. Of course, American roasteries and cafes care how they look and feel, but this seemed on another level, a whole different way of tying together coffee and design.

### Fritz Coffee Company

[Fritz (프리츠)](http://fritz.co.kr/) is a coffee & bread company which has a seal as their mascot. In contrast to my aforementioned sterile cafe, they (impressively successfully) evoked a homey feeling in their space while maintaining their branding. The seal, and the weathered wood and ship/bar-esque motif is used all over their space, from their mugs (yes, I got one) to their bathroom signs. This is the cup I got, which is only their current iteration of how their coffee is served.

Their counter space, which gives a good idea of how the whole shop looked. You can see their past cups in the top left, and how their branding has evolved (yet not drastically changed, maintaining the cafe's character.)

A closer look. I wonder what the minimum order is, especially since they clearly serve enough coffee to warrant Christmas cups.

Their whole bean coffees. Blends are in standard looking bags, while single origins are in more unique ones. I believe I tried the San Jose Javanica, which was a touch too herbal for me.

### Anthracite Coffee Roasters

Next was [Anthracite Coffee Roasters](http://www.anthracitecoffee.com). They had more of a concrete and glass storefront, initially unassuming, but clean and well-executed.

As I mentioned before, cafes are viewed as meeting spaces, and thus seating space is limited. To help remedy this, some cafes offer 1-2000 won discounts if you order your coffee to-go instead of for drinking there. Anthracite was one of those, and so I got my favorite cup of coffee in Korea (I forget exactly what it was, but I want to say it was an Ethiopian) for only 3000 won (~2.50 USD).

Their whole bean coffees are packed with blends in the black and white bags, and single origins in boxes with labels.

My coffee experience in Korea was awesome, especially as someone who thinks that design is vital for all companies, no matter what their product. A lot of specialty coffee in America does just fine in branding, though, I just thought that sometimes, that extra mile really is worth it and can really change how people enjoy coffee in a space.
