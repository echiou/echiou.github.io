Had the opportunity to present one of the projects I worked on over summer at the opening ceremony of [Jacobs Hall](http://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/), the new institute for "Design Innovation" at UC Berkeley.

The building puts student innovation front and center, with exhibits for student projects at the entrances. The murals in the stairways were designed by an architecture student, who juxtaposed various stylized hands of students explaining their research.

Various rooms around the hall have tools to make and prototype everything, ranging from your typical building tools...

...to sewing machines and laser cutters.

3D printers on 3D printers.

The [Type A Series 1](http://www.typeamachines.com/products/series1-3dprinter) hard at work.

Various applications of laser cutting. The rounded effect of the boat is created by the [kerf cuts](http://www.theartofdoingstuff.com/kerf-cutting-how-to-bend-wood-with-your-mind-i-mean-saw/) on the wood made by the laser, as shown in the piece of wood below it.

The building design for the [Civil and Environmental Engineering](http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/) Seismic Competition Team, built to withstand earthquakes as well as their residual effects, such as tsunamis and fire.

A showroom for the designs produced by the [Interactive Seating Design Competition](http://engineering.berkeley.edu/2015/08/interactive-seating-new-course-models-design-innovation-education) class, offered in Fall 2014. Designs included a rocking chair to charge your phone and a set of chairs to allow better coworking, grouping people by common interest or skills.

Andrea Deng presenting [SKRT](https://www.hackster.io/team-skrt/skrt), a skirt protecting the user's "personal bubble", expanding outwards as people approach it.

Finally, [my project](/work/metamorphe-zoetrope/) and setup, with accompanying unorthodox poster. It was a lot of fun (and very dehydrating) to present it to everyone who walked by.

It's a beautiful new space, and I hope to continue to be involved in the design community at Cal in the coming years.
