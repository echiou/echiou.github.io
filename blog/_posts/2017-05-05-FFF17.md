Dead week, working on a project due at midnight 4 days ago, but with 4 slip days.

Chicago this week, as is the "stack-of-queues" tradition.

First stop was La Colombe, which has draft lattes on tap. This wasn't mine, it was just on the table next to ours once vacated.

![][Girl & The Goat]

Definetely 100% not robot girl, sans goat.
