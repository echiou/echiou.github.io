Despite having gone to Cal for two years, I've never done the hike to the Big "C". I tried once in my freshman year, getting (myself and six or so visitors) hopelessly lost in the hills of Berkeley and had since been scared to go back. But when one of those visitors decided to stop by again, this time with different friends, I thought I'd give it one more go, this time hopefully with fewer hitches.

### Ethan Presents: How to Get to the Big "C"
With additional commentary!

**Step 1:** Locate the parking lot next to The Greek Theatre, by Maxwell Family Field & Bowles, despite accidentally heading east and nearly reaching Foothill instead before realizing. Go up that until you get to the second level of the large parking lot behind the theatre.

**Step 2:** Head east at the parking lot until you come to a trailhead, go up the concrete path (which turns to dirt) until you come to a fork in the road. Pick it up (sigh) and take the left path.

**Step 3:** Follow the path until you reach the swing (a relatively sharp curve uphill).

**Step 4:** Enjoy the view from the swing and the shade. (Side note: all hail our morrow crane overlord.)

**Bonus Step:** Continue following the path, but go off it because it doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Find a path that leads you to where you started, but not before you run through a hive of bees.

**Step 5:** Eventually see what appears to be the Big "C", despite not being near any visible path. Clamber straight up the hill, tripping a few times before you get there and realize that if you just properly followed that path you went off, you would have been there 20 minutes ago. Run into a turkey gang.

**Step 6:** Climb to the top and look down at the large hill you just got up. Refuse to post an actual picture of the Big "C" because you didn't really get any good ones.

**Step 7:** After finishing the hike, continue going downhill until you reach downtown Berkeley, then Gourmet Ghetto. Reward yourself with gelato.
