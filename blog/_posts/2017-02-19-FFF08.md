On a Saturday (actually... Sunday lol) again. Now onto Myanmar, the last trip I took before leaving Singapore.

Landed in Bagan to catch the sunset - we came back to this spot for a couple more sunrises and sunsets so... prepare for that.

View from the other side - the popular foggy look is actually smoke from fires.

Liftoff.

Balloons, temples, and greenery.
