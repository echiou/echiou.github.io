Another week, another Saturday. It's Cal Day today, but I think I have 2 more lectures to watch before I can start studying for CS162. But on the other hand, almost done!

Icelandic moss, recommended by "50 Romantic Things to do in Iceland" to erm... lie down in with your SO.

More waterfall!

Tim, who according to proportion of images on the blog, is my best friend ever. Maybe he just likes posing.

My pictures can't do it justice, but Eyjafjörður Fjord next to Akureyri was one of the most serene sights I've seen. We just stood by it taking it all in and hung out for a while. And this was literally next to a parking lot.

Akureyri has hearts as red stoplights, and I think that that's pretty cool.
