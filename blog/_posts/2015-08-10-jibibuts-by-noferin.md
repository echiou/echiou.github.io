I recently developed an interest in designer toys, and this was the first figurine in what I hope will be a reasonably sized collection.

[Jibibuts](http://noferin.com/2011/jibibuts) were released in 2009 by [Noferin](http://http://noferin.com), a pair of artists that work in plush and wood, rather than the more traditional vinyl or resin.

Jibibuts are made from rubber trees, which are planted for their latex, but used to be burned down when their yields diminished. In recent times, however, it has become more common to recover the wood for furniture production (or in this case, toys).

I found this at [Kidrobot SF](http://www.kidrobot.com/) for about $10. The inexpensive nature of these toys really appeals to me - it's like collecting art, but cheaper.

The blind-box aspect of the toys is also neat; you don't know what you got until you open the box, which is part of the charm, especially for my inner child.

Noferin took the time to craft a backstory for these creatures, imagining an island, Carrara, from which they hail, researched by the "Biological Institute of Carrara". This translates to the 14 possible figurines one can get from the box - six species, each in both male (more colorful) and female (brown-towned) variations, as well as two "unknown species", which are "chaser" figures.

I'm personally enamored by packaging design and feel that it's an extremely important aspect of a product. This is especially the case in blind-box designer toys like this, as opening the box is half the fun.

Unfortunately, I found the packaging of the Jibibuts to be a bit lacking. The cardboard felt flimsy and the wood print just looked kind of cheap. Also, the typography on the side had a strange font and was justified weirdly (which is a bit nitpicky, but it really does detract from the overall experience for me). One thing I did like was the various renderings of each of the possible figurines.

Upon opening the box, I was greeted by a bit of tissue paper holding my Jibibut, which seemed a bit tacky, but I suppose was more environmentally friendly than the plastic bag usually found holding such toys.

I got a male Dili!

He appears to be made entirely out of solid wood, very hefty. I really like the choice of material; each one is unique thanks to the grain.

Love the colors on his head, as well as the maple leaf pattern.

I will admit to dropping him a few times while setting him up, but the workmanship seems to be solid so far, no cracks or scratches.

The paint job and his expression just make him so cute!

Solidly built, well chosen shape, colors, and expression, and I enjoy the environmental angle Noferin is going for. The worst part was probably the packaging, but otherwise a really nice and cute toy.

Enjoying his new home.
