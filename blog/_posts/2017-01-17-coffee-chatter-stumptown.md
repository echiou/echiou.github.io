I was in Portland, Oregon this past week and of course, on my to-see list was [Stumptown Coffee Roasters](stumptowncoffee.com). There are differing opinions about their current quality & standards as people talking about an organization as large and "developed" as Stumptown are wont to have, but a visit was almost necessary, at the very least, for historical relevance. Luckily, during their [HQ Tour](https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/locations/portland/annex) (my untrained tongue and) I found the coffee to be as good as any other I've had. My other datapoints of the Portland Coffee scene were [Heart](heartroasters.com) and [Coava](coavacoffee.com), both of which were also quite good.

We started the tour in the lobby with a couple sample cups of Stumptowns current offering - a Guatemala, an Ethiopia, and a blend.

Our tour guide also told us how [direct trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_trade) coffee worked and how Stumptown fit into that category, fostering relationships with coffee producers and investing in up-and-coming producers.

Only the hippest of offices. Looks like the right combination of practical and aesthetic.

Everyone got a bag of this at the end of the tour (jk, it was only a half pound).

We finished off the tour by trying Stumptown's various cold brew offerings - first the black which they had on tap, and then the various cartoned ones. The story behind the coconut cream cold brew was quite interesting - they first tried more traditional plant milks like almond and soy, but couldn't get the quality & consistency quite where they wanted. Eventually, they tested coconut cream, which was perhaps a bit unconventional, but it met their standards and they decided to go with it.
